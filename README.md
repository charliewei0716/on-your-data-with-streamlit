# Azure OpenAI On Your Data with Python Streamlit

This repository leverages Azure OpenAI's native [On Your Data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/use-your-data) feature and integrates it with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), a robust framework for developing web applications purely in Python. The goal is to create an MVP for RAG with the most streamlined architecture possible.
